import the nessecary libraries required for manipulation and organization of folders

detect which os is being ran, and adjust the paths from here on out as nessecary

ask which path to organize

ask how they would like to organize it

organization part:
    organize the folder according to the way they would like to
    remove duplicate files
    while this is happening, display a little ascii spinner using braille symbols

say Well done and exit the program
